Currently:
Made CK.Env.Sys packable, I think this will make it a publishable nuget packet and will be shared by CKli/CCB
Copy/Pasted TemporarySolution from Cake.Common.

Planned:
Removing Cake from CCB.
Refactoring CK.Env => CKli.
Offloading work from CKli to CCB.
Renaming the CodeCakeBuilder ? It has nothing to do with Cake now... But it will be a huge effort if this is not automated...
