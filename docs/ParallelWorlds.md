# Parallel Worlds

Parallel Worlds are not yet totally defined.

You can create a Parallel World right now, by running `World/GenerateParallelWorld`

:warning:This will create and push to remote a new branch on all repositories of a World.

We currently use the Parallel World to manage LTS versions accross a stack.

This feature is WIP.
