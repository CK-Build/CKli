# Parallel Worlds

Parallel Worlds are not yet totally defined.

You can create a Parallel World right now, by running `World/GenerateParallelWorld`

:warning:This will create and push to remote 3 new branch on all repositories of a World.
This will also create a new World.xml file, it represent the parrel world, and the parrelel world will be displayed next to the regular worlds.

We currently use the Parallel World to manage [LTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) versions accross a stack.

This feature is WIP.
