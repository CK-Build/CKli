# The World Config



# Creating A Brand New World

## Creating a World

A World is stored in a repository. You can use a existing repository that already host a world, or you can create an empty repository.



## `develop` required

Currently, git repositories are checked out on the `develop` branch instead of their default one. Checkout will fail if repositories don't have a `develop` branch.

Please ensure all repositories in the various `*-World.xml` have a `develop` branch.
